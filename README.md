# MongoDB + ExpressJS + ReactJS + Webpack
Test app to apply MongoDB + ExpressJS + ReactJS + Webpack

This project focus on use of the follow stack: 

MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.com/)

ExpressJS (https://expressjs.com/)

ReactJS (https://facebook.github.io/react/)

## Tools and Super Libs present in this project

This project use mongoose(http://mongoosejs.com/) to access MongoDB from Node application server.

I also use mongoose-paginate(https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-paginate) to perform pagination query. This plugin is amazing!

This project use Webpack (https://webpack.github.io/)

...and invite you to use Sublime or Atom to write your code!

The project not focus to manage front-end dependencies like bower. However, this SPA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) project use CDN to import bootstrap, jquery and ReactJS.
Feel free to improve and apply an better approach for front-end architecture.

## Prerequistes

1 - Install Node.js and update npm (https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

2 - I assume you know MongoDB and already use to your study ;) (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/)
